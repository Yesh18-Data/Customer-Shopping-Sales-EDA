# Customer-Shopping-Sales-EDA

### Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to analyze customer shopping data to understand sales patterns, customer demographics, and transaction behaviors. Specifically, we aim to identify trends in sales across different categories, demographics, and payment methods, as well as to determine peak transaction days to optimize business operations and enhance customer experience.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1. **Total Sales by Gender**: Measure the total revenue generated by male and female customers.
2. **Total Sales by Age Group**: Evaluate sales distribution across various age groups.
3. **Sales by Category**: Determine the contribution of each product category to total sales.
4. **Payment Methods by Shopping Mall**: Analyze the distribution of payment methods used in different shopping malls.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Converted `invoice_date` to datetime format.
   - Extracted hour from `invoice_date` for rush hour analysis.
   - Created new columns for `age_group` and `Year`.

2. **Data Aggregation**:
   - Grouped data by gender, age group, and category to summarize total sales.
   - Aggregated transaction counts by hour to identify peak periods.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Created bar plots, pie charts, and heatmaps to visualize sales trends and payment methods.
   - Generated line plots and bar plots to analyze transaction distribution by hour.

### Findings
1. **Sales by Gender**:
   - Total sales figures indicate which gender contributes more to overall revenue.
   
2. **Sales by Age Group**:
   - Identified the most lucrative age groups based on sales data.
   
3. **Sales by Category**:
   - Highlighted which categories are the top performers and which contribute less to overall sales.

4. **Payment Methods by Shopping Mall**:
   - Revealed how different payment methods are utilized across various shopping malls.
